Users could edit the survye at web server, and the web server will create a QR Code.
Users scan the QR Code with app (just like gif 1), the app will download json file from the web in QR Code and create a survey as the json file content (like gif 2).
When users finish the survey, the app will send the result as another json file to web server (like gif 3).
At last, users should finish a gesture-lock to unlock the app to quit.

The gif files are in folder "gif".

The app now could do:
	scan an usable QR Code and get json file from it
	create the whole survey as the content of usable json file
	send result json file to web server when the survey is finished
	at the end, users must finish a gesture-lock to quit, and the password which also in json file will be shown on the screen
The app maybe would do:
	edit survey and create json file at local without wen server.
